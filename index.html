        <p>We believe the Holy Ghost to be the third member of the Godhead. The Godhead consists of three individuals: God the Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost. While Heavenly Father and Christ both have physical bodies of flesh and bone like we do, the Holy Ghost has only a spiritual body. This allows the Holy Ghost's influence to be everywhere and serve as a connection between us and Heavenly Father. The Holy Ghost is also known as the Holy Spirit or the Comforter.</p>

        <h2>How does the Holy Ghost Help Us?</h2>
        <p id="pmg_quote">"Through the Holy Ghost, we can feel God's love for us."</p>
        <p>“The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of Heavenly Father's greatest gifts. The Holy Ghost cleanses and sanctifies us, making us more holy, more complete, more like God (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p20#p20" target="_blank">3 Nephi 27:20</a>). He helps us change and grow spiritually as we seek to follow God's precepts.</p>
        <p>The Holy Ghost helps us learn and recognize truth (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p5#p5" target="_blank">Moroni 10:5</a>). He also confirms truth to our hearts and minds. Additionally, the Holy Ghost helps us teach truth (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p14#p12" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 42:14</a>). When we learn and teach truth by the power of the Holy Ghost, He carries it unto our hearts (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=p1#p1" target="_blank">2 Nephi 33:1</a>) . . .</p>
        <p>The Holy Ghost will help us through the challenges of life. He will comfort us during times of trial or sorrow, filling us with hope (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p26#26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moroni 8:26</a>). Through the Holy Ghost, we can feel God's love for us.”</p>

        <h2>How can I know if I am feeling the Holy Ghost?</h2>
        <p>Everyone feels the influence of the Holy Ghost in their own way. Some feel the Holy Ghost instantly. Others feel it more gradually. In the following video, David A. Bednar teaches about how we can recognize and feel the influence of the Holy Ghost in our own lives.</p>

        <h2>My Testimony</h2>
        <p>I know that the Holy Ghost is always there for me. There are times when I feel lost, confused, or stressed about life, but I can always rely on the Holy Ghost to bring back peace and comfort that I need in my life. The Holy Ghost helps me most by helping me be calm. There are times when I wish that God would give me straight-forward answers and make things easier, but I have found that the peace I recieve from the Holy Ghost helps me keep going even when I do not have all of the answers.</p>
